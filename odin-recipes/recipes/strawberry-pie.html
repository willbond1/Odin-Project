        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This strawberry pie is my favorite pie, and it's very easy to make.
            I got the recipe many years ago in North Jersey from the Sussex County Strawberry Farm. </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart strawberries</li>
            <li>1 9 in pie crust, baked</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange 1/2 of strawberries in baked pastry shell. Place remaining strawberries in a medium saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add sugar to the strawberries in the saucepan; place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Gradually stir cornstarch mixture into boiling strawberry mixture.
                Reduce heat and simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Pour cooked strawberry mixture over berries in pastry shell. Refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Before serving, whip cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Serve each slice of pie with a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
